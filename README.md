A collection of small React practice projects and challenges by husainsaqib56.

## Projects

- `01-react-random-advice` — Vite + React project (random advice generator).
- `02-JS-review` — JavaScript practice file(s).
- `03-pizza-menu` — Create React App project (pizza menu demo).
- `04-travel-list` — Create React App project (travel packing list exercise).
- `05-accordion-example` — Create React App project (accordion UI exercise).
- `06-steps` — Create React App project (steps UI exercise).
- `07-tip-calculator` — Create React App project (tip calculator challenge).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (recommended >= 16)
- npm (or yarn)

## How to run a project

Open a terminal in the project folder you want to run, for example:

```bash
cd 07-tip-calculator
npm install
npm start
```

Notes:
- Projects using Create React App use `npm start` (found in `package.json` scripts).
- The Vite-based project (`01-react-random-advice`) uses `npm run dev`.

## Structure

Each subfolder contains a standalone app with its own `package.json`. Run commands inside the subfolder for that project.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute or add explanations for individual projects, open a PR with the changes in the corresponding folder.

## License

Add a license file (e.g., `LICENSE`) if you want to set licensing. Currently unspecified.

---

If you want, I can:
- Add badges (CI, license) and a demo section.
- Create individual READMEs inside each project folder with run instructions.
- Commit the `README.md` and open a PR.

Tell me which of these you'd like next.
